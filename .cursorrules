# Overview

This is a blog / business promotional website for the Southern Zone / zona sud in Costa Rica. We use it to make SEO friendly, discoverable sites for local businesses under our uvita-ojochal.com domain. This is a free community service. 

Always create English and Spanish versions of every page

the spanish translation needs to be visible and available. switching between languages should not introduce any bugs. 

The writing style should be friendly, warm, attractive to tourists. Authentic but also slightly "Sales" oriented for driving people to local businesses.
