      <div class="about-text">
        <p>We are a family from Colorado in the United States. We can’t get enough of the mountains, being outdoors, and taking
          our pup Spyro with us everywhere we go. We love, love, loved living in Colorado. My husband works in tech and I am a
          speech-language pathologist.</p>
        <p>
          Even with our professional-level jobs, life in the US felt like an endless treadmill: work-cook-dinner-sleep-wake up-
          work… We didn’t have as much time, money, or energy for the adventures we wanted to have. We started talking about
          moving somewhere new.</p>
        <p>But when you’re from one of the most beautiful places on the planet, where do you possibly go from there?
        </p>
        <p>We considered the Pacific Northwest of the US, but it has all the same problems of unaffordability as here, and then
          some. We also thought about Hawaii: beautiful with tropical weather, but likely even less affordable than Colorado.
        </p>
        <p>In November 2024 for probably no specific reason, we started thinking about moving out of the US. The possibilities
          were endless. We’re an active, healthy couple with an extremely active, adaptable 6 year old. Mickey knows French; I
          know some Spanish. We considered France or somewhere in the EU, but it seemed like many of our options were just a
          sidestep– a horizontal move that would certainly be a different life, but a better one? Was that even possible?</p>
        <p>What were we looking for? A gorgeous location, nice weather, happy people, a laid-back culture, an escape from the
          endless consumerism, delicious food, and plenty of outdoor activities.
        </p>
        <p>Our search whittled down to Central America and then to Costa Rica. It checked all the boxes on our list and then
          some: Costa Rica is in the central time zone– meaning we can work remotely for US companies much more easily.
        </p>
        <p>Join us as we pack up our lives in the USA and start anew in the jungles of Costa Rica.</p>
